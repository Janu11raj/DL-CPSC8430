This repository contains Deep Learning Course (CPSC-8430)-Homework 1
All the assignment tasks are performed on jupyter notebooks and saved in .ipynb files, which has all the required packages setup in the environment and run the cells in the file from top to bottom.
Report: Reports folder contains the report for this assignment in PDF format.

# # Homework-1:
1.Deep vs. Shallow
    1.1 Simulate a Function
    1.1 Train on Actual Tasks using shallow and deep models 
2.Optimization
    1.2 Visualize the Optimization Process
    1.2 Observe Gradient Norm during Training
    1.2 What Happened when Gradient is almost zero
3.Generalization
    1.3 Can network fit random labels?
    1.3 Number of parameters vs. Generalization 
    1.3 Flatness vs. Generalization Part-1
    1.3 Flatness vs. Generalization Part-2
The dataset required to run the source code is the MNIST dataset form the torchvision datasets library in pytorch. Once the dataset is downloaded to this pathfile, it can be used by every other file and is the only file that needs to be downloaded.   
### Package Required
    1. pytorch
    2. tensorflow
    3. numpy
    4. matplotlib.pyplot
    5. torch
    6. pandas
    7. torchvision
